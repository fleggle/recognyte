We might have to modify the previously created files, for example because of a new Nexus version. We
want this to automatically be deployed to a test environment after we have made the changes on Git.
Please describe in a few words how you would satisfy this need.

Firstly, it would be necessary to alter the entry in the dockerfile and make any other alterations that may
be required of a new version, such as possible port changes etc. 
Next, a cicd tool such as jenkins would be used to monitor the repo for changes either via polling or utilising
webhooks allowing triggers on push for instance. The triggered build that would then create a new verison of the docker
image and push to a docker registry (artifactory, ECR etc.) Jenkins then deploys the updated configuration files 
(including the new image tag) to the test environment using something to the effect of 
kubectl set image deployment/nexus-deployment nexus=my-nexus-image:<new-image-tag>
